Creating a blog application that stores user details on the local storage (browser).

## HTML, CSS and Javascript 
 HTML is a markup language and CSS is a styling language. JavaScript, however, is a programming language. Hence, they are all web languages, but they perform different jobs.

 HTML will be referred to as the physical body, CSS will be the body’s accessories and JavaScript is the body’s ability to talk or move. All of these ‘bodily aspects’ need to work together to form a functional, visually appealing, interactive website.

### HTML

*The Body

*HyperText Markup Language (HTML)

*Content and basic structure

*Describes and defines

*Made up of tags

*Tells the browser what to display

### CSS

*The Accessories

*Cascading Style Sheet (CSS)

*Gives style and structure to the content

*Link the CSS file to the HTML

*Tells the browser how to display

### JavaScript

*The body’s ability to perform actions

*JavaScript is not Java

*Behaviour of the website

*Used for interactive functionality

*Allows for the user to interact with the browser

### Localstorage
The read-only localStorage property allows you to access a Storage object for the Document's origin; the stored data is saved across browser sessions. localStorage is similar to sessionStorage, except that while data stored in localStorage has no expiration time, data stored in sessionStorage gets cleared when the page session ends — that is, when the page is closed. (Data in a localStorage object created in a "private browsing" or "incognito" session is cleared when the last "private" tab is closed.)
